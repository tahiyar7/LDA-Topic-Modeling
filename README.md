# LDA-Topic-Modeling
Latent Dirichlect Topic Modeling on the authors with their reads link over 350+ and over more than 1000+ of documents mined to create a outcome for the Topics overly popular. 
In my project:

Outcome: 

The coherence score of 0.4962 indicates the overall quality and interpretability of topics generated by a topic modeling algorithm. A coherence score of 0.4962 suggests that the topics are relatively coherent and meaningful, with 14 topics being the optimal number identified by the algorithm when using an alpha value of 0.3 and automatically determined beta values. This indicates that the model has successfully identified distinct and coherent themes within the data, offering valuable insights for analysis.

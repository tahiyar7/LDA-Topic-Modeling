# LDA-Topic-Modeling
Latent Dirichlect Topic Modeling on the authors with their reads link over 350+ and over more than 1000+ of documents mined to create a outcome for the Topics overly popular. 
In my project:

We can see that the result is 

"The highest coherence score is : 0.4962 for number of topics = 14 alpha = 0.3 and beta = auto."
Which means, Outcome: 

** My coherence score of 0.4962 indicates high quality and interpretability of generated topics.

** The algorithm identified 14 topics as optimal, utilizing an alpha value of 0.3 and automatically determined beta values.

** This suggests the model successfully captured distinct and coherent themes within the data, providing valuable insights for analysis.
